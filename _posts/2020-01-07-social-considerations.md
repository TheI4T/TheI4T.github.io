### Social considerations

Since there is essentially one internet it would be, if run by a business, a monopoly. We can agree that people won't stand for that. The I4T will need to be run by something like ICANN. So, there's no profit to be made inventing it. No startup would survive by creating The I4T. 

Large companies are understandably reluctant to rely on any fundamental technology that is not created and controlled by them yet, for reasons outlined above, they can create new intranets or iot standards and they will never be adopted. 

Obviously it's going to need to be open source. The accounting will need to be transparent. 

Some form of logging will be necessary but identifying information should not be collected in any way.
