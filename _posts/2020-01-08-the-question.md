## The Question

Are the mqtt brokers of the intranets of things ever going to join into one big IoT network?

By now the architectural patterns of IoT systems are becoming clear. Pub/Sub, eg. MQTT, is the dominate paradigm. The virtue is that messages can be sent to devices when the devices have a channel that they subscribe to. This is the IoT equivalent of the devices having network addresses, like devices on The Internet have. Google Cloud IoT and Amazon IoT offer services but what they offer is isolated networks where devices from different manufacturers cannot message each other. This is the IoT equivalent of an intranet. 

If all IoT devices shared the same address space then interoperability would be greatly enhanced. Isn't that inevitable? When? How about now?

Why is Ipv6 and a better DNS not taking care of this already? 


### Conclusions

While my meager contributions here may or may not prove useful it's clear that eventually The I4T will arrive and will have desirable properties.
